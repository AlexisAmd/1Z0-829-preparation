# Exceptions and Localization
## Error Classes
| Error              | Description              | 
|:-------------------|:-------------------------|
| ExceptionInInitializerError              | Thrown when static initializer throws exception and doesnâ€™t handle it |
| StackOverflowError | Thrown when method calls itself too many times (called infinite recursion because method typically calls itself without end)              |
| NoClassDefFoundError | Thrown when class that code uses is available at com- pile time but not runtime              |

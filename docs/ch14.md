# I/O
### File vs Path
```java
java.io.File;
java.nio.file.Path;

```
## Path
Path is immutable. This line is ignored:
```java
Path p1;
p1.normalize().relativize(Path.of("/lion"));
```

### Resolve
Calling resolve() with an absolute path as a parameter returns the absolute path.
```java
jshell>
var p1 = Path.of("/tmp")
p1 ==> /tmp

jshell> var p2 = Path.of("enrico")
p2 ==> enrico

jshell> var p3 = Path.of("/users")
p3 ==> /users

jshell> p1.resolve(p2)
$4 ==> /tmp/enrico

jshell> p2.resolve(p1)
$5 ==> /tmp

jshell> p1.resolve(p3)
$6 ==> /users

jshell> p3.resolve(p1)
$7 ==> /tmp

```

### relativize
Both paths to be absolute or relative.
```java
    Path path1 = Path.of("tmp/fish.txt");
    Path path2 = Path.of("/user/friendly/birds.txt");

    System.out.println(path1.relativize(path2));
```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: 'other' is different type of Path

### System.in System.out
**Do not close!**  
Because these are static objects, the System streams are shared by the entire application.  
The JVM creates and opens them for us. They can be used in a try-with-resources statement
or by calling close(), although closing them is not recommended. 

### Files.deleteIfExists()
```java
public static boolean deleteIfExists(Path path)
                              throws IOException
```
It throws a checked exception.

## Reader.mark()

### StringReader.mark()

_Marks the present position in the stream. Subsequent calls to reset() will reposition the stream to this point.
Params: readAheadLimit â€“ Limit on the number of characters that may be read while still preserving the mark. 
Because the stream's input comes from a string, there is no actual limit, so this argument must not be negative, but is otherwise ignored._

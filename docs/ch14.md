# I/O
### File vs Path
```java
java.io.File;
java.nio.file.Path;

```
### relativize
Both paths to be absolute or relative.
```java
    Path path1 = Path.of("tmp/fish.txt");
    Path path2 = Path.of("/user/friendly/birds.txt");

    System.out.println(path1.relativize(path2));
```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: 'other' is different type of Path

### System.in System.out
**Do not close!**  
Because these are static objects, the System streams are shared by the entire application.  
The JVM creates and opens them for us. They can be used in a try-with-resources statement
or by calling close(), although closing them is not recommended.

# Concurrency

### Thread interrupt

interrupt() only impacts a thread that is in a **WAITING** or **TIMED_WAITING** state.  
Calling interrupt() on a thread in a **NEW** or **RUNNABLE** state has no impact

### ScheduledExecutorService

```java
public interface ScheduledExecutorService extends ExecutorService {...
}
```

```java
ScheduledExecutorService service=
    Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();
```

### Parallel Stream

The forEachOrdered() method will process the elements in the order in which they are stored in the
stream.

### Reduce

```java
Stream<T> stream

<U> U reduce(U identity,
    BiFunction<U,? super T,U>accumulator,
    BinaryOperator<U> combiner)
```

Performs a reduction on the elements of this stream, using the provided identity, accumulation and
combining functions.

## ExecutorService

### Methods

```java
Future<?> submit(Runnable task)

<T> Future<T> submit(Callable<T> task)
    
void execute(Runnable command) //from the parent Executor
```
Calling get on Future<?> returns null.

### Shutdown

```java
    void executor(){
    ExecutorService executorService=Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
    try{
    executorService.submit(printInventory);
    }finally{
    //if you do not call this the method
    //the code will run but never terminate,
    executorService.shutdown();
    }
    }
```

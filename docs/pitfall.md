# Pitfalls and Tips
## Watch out
- **case** is a reserved keyword in java
- mind the **IOException** when you use t*ry with resources*
- JDBC: PreparedStatement will use the existing parameter set if you donâ€™t replace it.
- Mind the type used in lambda, there ain't auto boxing. Options D and E are incorrect because the type is Integer in the predicate and int in the lambda.

## I/O
- mind the checked exception within lambda, example: toRealPath()
- mark, check if the stream supports mark: inputStream.markSupported()
- What I/O classes to use? Reader/Writer for text, Stream for primitives and String values
- Check if the System.out or System.err is closed within the try-with-resource

## Concurrency
- the Concurrent classes order read/write access such that access to the class is consistent 
across all threads and processes, while the synchronized classes do not. 
- Future.get() throws  InterruptedException and a  ExecutionException, and they block execution 
- scheduled methods: newScheduledThreadPool(10)/newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor()

## Stream
-  IntSummaryStatistics, not IntegerSummaryStatistics. 
-  Do not confuse IntStream with Stream<Integer>
- Stream.concat(s1, s2) works only with 2 streams
- Optional.orElseThrow()
## Lambda
- `var x = ()->"hello"` does not compile! - you cannot assign a lambda to a var
- check the right symbol! it's -> NOT =>

## Various
- check if a field is final in the code

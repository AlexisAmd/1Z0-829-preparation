# Pitfalls and Tips
## Watch out
- **case** is a reserved keyword in java
- mind the **IOException** when you use try with resources*
- JDBC: PreparedStatement will use the existing parameter set if you donâ€™t replace it.
- Mind the type used in lambda, there ain't auto boxing. 

## I/O
- mind the checked exception within lambda, example: `toRealPath()`
- mark, check if the stream supports mark: `inputStream.markSupported()`
- What I/O classes to use? Reader/Writer for text, Stream for primitives and String values
- Check if the `System.out` or `System.err` is closed within the try-with-resource
- in the try-with-resources check curly parenthesis is used, not brackets.

## Concurrency
- the Concurrent classes order read/write access such that access to the class is consistent 
across all threads and processes, while the synchronized classes do not. 
- `Future.get()` throws  `InterruptedException` and a  `ExecutionException`, and they block execution 
- scheduled methods: `newScheduledThreadPool(10)`/`newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor()`

## Stream
-  `IntSummaryStatistics`, not ~~IntegerSummaryStatistics~~. 
- Do not confuse `IntStream` with `Stream<Integer>`
- `Stream.concat(s1, s2)` works only with 2 streams, not more parameters
- `Optional.orElseThrow()`
- check if there is more than one terminal operation

## Lambda
- `var x = ()->"hello"` does not compile! - **you cannot assign a lambda to a var**
- check the right symbol! it's -> NOT =>
- check lambda does not throw a Checked exception

## Various
- check if a field is final in the code
- `enum`: check if the constructor is private, or protected!
- `switch` expression: You CANNOT use `return`;
- `instanceOf` : a class can always be an instance of an Interface, so the instanceOf in that case is allowed. !!!!
- variable names: `_` can be allowed but not as a char single: `var _` does not compile

## Interfaces
- default method: `Plant.super.leaves()` NOT ~~super.Plant.leaves()~~
## Classes
- if there is an abstract method  makes sure the class is declared `abstract`.
### Nested Classes
- A local class can access only **final** and **effectively final** local variables
- anonymous class needs to have semicolon at the end.
## Exception
- Check if the variable for the exception, **e**, is not already defined
- check that main throws the checked exception declared in the method
especially with the AutoClosable resources

## JDBC
- ResultSet rs: `rs.next()` NOT ~~rs.hasNext()~~
- `ResultSet.getInt(1)` NOT ~~ResultSet.getInteger(1)~~
- watch out the overlap of `conn.savepoint()` and `conn.rollback()`

## Serialization
- always check the class implements `Serializable`
## java.time
- only `ZonedDateTime` has the `toInstant()` method!!
